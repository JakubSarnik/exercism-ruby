The exercise requires you to write a class that provides a method for each child in the kindergarten.
You can make your work less repetitive (and more fun!) if, instead of manually defining 12 different methods, you use a bit of metaprogramming.
If you're not sure where to start, explore the [`method_missing`](https://www.leighhalliday.com/ruby-metaprogramming-method-missing) or [`define_method`](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/2-metaprogramming-ruby/chapters/25-dynamic-methods/lessons/72-define-method) methods.
